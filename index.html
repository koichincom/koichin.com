        <p>
            Hi, I'm Koichi Nakayamada, a Computer Science student at De Anza College, Cupertino, CA. 
            I was born and raised in Japan and was born in 2004. 
            My vision is to advance humanity through technology, and I believe that brain-machine interfaces represent one of the most significant fields in this pursuit during my lifetime.
